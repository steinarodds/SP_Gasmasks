# SP_Gasmasks

Svisual Mod that is being created for the public (Once ready) and for stalkers paradise


I am very quite new  to Dayz scripting so i doubt you will be able to use this for learning purposes but you are welcome to learn from my files.

All i ask is that you do not steal the Texture files since they do not belong to me i have simply compiled them together to make them work for dayz.
